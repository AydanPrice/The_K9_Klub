- Ideas For Project -

At first, my group though that our project should be of a gallery showing off ideas for inventions that anybody could contribute to. However, we soon realized that we could not start off the page without inventions from other people, relying on too much randomness on whether anybody had wanted to contribute to it. And thus, we decided to scrap it early on.

Next, my group thought that a web repair service was good. So, we got a little bit into that idea because that is what my friend wants to do when he grows up and we realized that it was very boring. So, one day, one of the group members changed it without anybody else’s knowledge.

Lastly, we thought that we should do something to do with dogs. This is because all of us love dogs. Plus, my friend’s gamer name is ‘Faolan’ which means ‘little wolf’ in Gaelic. We soon decided that a dog daycare center would be best. And that is the project we stuck with.

- Design Perspective -

At the start, we thought of doing a heavily wolf focused page, to bring out the Faolan meaning. However, people who we talked to said that the wolf theme was too creepy and should no be associated with a cute little ball of fluff. So, we decided to change the theme into what a doggy daycare is all about, dogs. We then built off of that concept for the rest of the duration of the project.

- Home Page -

We wanted our home page to catch your eye immediately. We looked up many pictures on the internet in order to find the best one and we ended up keeping a puppy in a cup. We did not want to overflow the home page with garbage, so we kept it minimalistic.

- Pricing Page -

The pricing page is a weird one. We didn’t know how to make a bunch of prices interesting so we just added a border and some paw prints that we hoped would add some color to an otherwise bland and sad page. We think that it came out well.

- Reservations Page -

In the beginning, we thought that the reservations page should have a caledndar that you could select your date and time from. However, since that would not be very easy at all on mobile devices, when we started making the website responsive, we scrapped the idea in favor of the more usual textboxes.

- Contact Page -

After a weird conversation about whether or not to include Instagram and Snapchat in our contacts list, we decided to keep the contacts listed to a minimum. And so, we have a Twitter and Facebook logo that links directly to the Facebook and Twitter pages that we hooked up for the business. They work fine, and the page just looks sleek.

- About Page -

We did not really have anything interesting to say on the about page so we just listed some ‘facts’ about our business. Then we spiced up the page a tiny bit.

- Account Page -

We made the account page that way we could make the other pages (Pricing) make sense. It just makes more sense to us than aa page like location.
